How to Run:
1) The function to call in your script is TestModel() located in test.py.  Import it to your script using "from test import TestModel".  Restart the kernel before the first time you use this line.
2) The function uses 2 arguments:
	- filename: path to the pickle file containing the python list of 2D numpy arrays.
	- model: use "ab" to use the model trained on a's and b's, use "all" to use the model trained on all letters
3) The function has 1 output: the model predictions on the input data.
4) An example can be seen in example_test.py

Note: A markdown version of this readme is also available.
